        <p>
          â˜ž The objective of the game is to roll the highest number on the dice.
          <!-- We can still edit the rules depending on how we plan our dice game -->
        </p>
        <ul id="rules">
          <li>This game consists of 3 rounds.</li>
          <li>The game is played between two players.</li>
          <li>Players are to take turns rolling the dice.</li>
          <li>
            On a player's turn, they roll the dice, and the number rolled
            becomes their score for that round.
          </li>
          <li>
            The player with the highest total score at the end of the game wins.
          </li>
          <li>If the player's score is the same, then it is a tie.</li>
